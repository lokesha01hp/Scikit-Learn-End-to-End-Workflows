# Scikit-Learn End-to-End Workflows

- This repo demonstrates the basics of machine learning using Scikit-Learn through clean, practical, end-to-end workflows. Instead of random code dumps, it systematically walks you through preparing data, choosing and fitting the right model, making predictions, evaluating performance, improving through experimentation, and saving/reusing your models.

- Each workflow folder contains clear explanations and executable code to understand not just how to use Scikit-Learn, but why each step matters in real-world ML projects. If you want to build, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models using Scikit-Learn in a practical, structured way, this repo gives you a clear, approachable path—perfect for beginners building a solid ML foundation or anyone refining their workflow.

1️⃣ **Getting data ready**  
2️⃣ **Picking the right model for your problem**  
3️⃣ **Fitting the model & making predictions**  
4️⃣ **Evaluating the model**  
5️⃣ **Improving through experimentation**  
6️⃣ **Saving & reloading your model**  
7️⃣ **Putting all together(optional)**

Each workflow contains **explanations + executable Python code** to understand and apply each step systematically.
